Changes we've made:
	1.  make document show in menu_order
		- shortcodes/documents.php
		- widgets/documents.php
		- vc-elements/documents.php

	2.  remove the LSR events
	  - lsvr-tookkit-townpress.php

  3.  Widgets -> notices.php (put sticky notices at top of the list)

  Some "overrides" are done by overriding the function in custom/townpress.php
	ex:  lsvr_modify_document_posts_per_page function to fix the blank expiration date issue.
